- Plotly

This project is structured in sections using different Jupyter notebooks for a smoother experience:
- EDA.ipynb notebook contains the work done for the Exploratory data analysis
- dim_reduction.ipynb notebook contains the work done for dimensionality reduction
- best_match.ipynb notebook contains the best match function developed for giving ingredient suggestions
- get_recipe.py is a helper script used by dim_reduction and EDA notebooks. There is no need to open this file as the functions contained in this script are called by the notebooks 
- requirements.txt file contains all the libraries used in the notebooks and Python scripts above

- /data folder contains the data collected for the MSc thesis from Bellosi (2011) used in this project.
- /report folder contains the LaTeX source code of the project report
